"
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.,
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.,
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.,
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.,
I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
